## An Introduction to JavaScript
Let’s see what’s so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and which other technologies play well with it.

## What is JavaScript?
An programming language which is build for make page more alive. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads in browser.

Javascripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

## Why is it called JavaScript?
When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
